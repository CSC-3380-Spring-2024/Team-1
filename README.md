# Team-1

Our app Palpedia acts as a companion/Database app to give information on the Breeding probabilities, Map information, and general PalPedia deck with all of the Pals stats. Our Homepage and UI was made in typescript, and our batabases on the backend are handled in SQL usign SQLite. We also have an interactive map and a filtered search bar to find the pals you need!
To use the project, initialize the expo project using npx create-expo-app in the terminal. After the app is created use any android emulator to be able to simulate the app.
